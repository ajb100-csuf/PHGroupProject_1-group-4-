GROUP 4: Alyssa Bautista, Salvador Marquez, and Isabella Velazquez

In this group project, we aim to act as a mock public health research team to conduct an analysis of health data from a population health survey.
The dataset used comes from the US National Cancer Institute Health Information National Trend Survey for the year 2020.
Using 8 variables of interest,
(Quality of care received, gender assigned at birth, smoking status, race/ethnicity, average number of alcoholic drinks per week, 
Minutes per week of at least moderate intensity exercise, and BMI), 
we intend to summarize, graph, and interpret the data to the best of our knowledge.
